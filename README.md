# Monopoly-Project

ESOF-322 Software Engineering project, with the program code written by me, the images gathered from Google, and the the test source code written by my two partners in the class, so credit to them.

This project is simply to be able to play a monopoly game, implementing all the rules, counting which square the player's on, the dice rolls, etc. and implementing an option to choose the theme of the game, altering board display, chance/community cards, and property names.
